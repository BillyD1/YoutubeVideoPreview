YouTube™ Video Preview helps you to determine if a video is what you are looking for by:

- adding video rating below each video image;
- when you mouse hover any video image you will see 3 thumbnails from that video.
For example you are searching for "michael jackson thriller" and you want to see official video not video from a concert, not a review, not someone making a cover or someone reviewing it. By putting your mouse hover each image you can see those thumbnails. Also using YouTube™ rating you can see if that video has a lower rating, maybe it has a lower sound quality or users found that has some issues.

It's easy and convenient, can help you determine what you really want to watch and not having to click on multiple images (wait for video to load) until you find the video you are interested in.
